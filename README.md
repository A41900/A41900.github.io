# Creative Landing Page

demo here: https://a41900.github.io

Personal landing page built with JavaScript and Canvas.
This project focuses on visual clarity and interaction, using a simplified version of my generative motion system rather than experimental exploration.
The motion logic and underlying system were developed separately and can be found here:
